# Da Heck is an RSS feed?

The problem: there's too much information on the internet to stay up to date without spending excessive time scrolling or checking for updates, not knowing if there are any.

RSS solves this by creating a space that informs you when sites/app you're interested in have updated.

It's a way to subscribe to a "source" of information, such as a Web site, and get brief updates delivered to you.

RSS - Really Simple Syndication

A "source" is referred to as a **feed**. You **subscribe** to a feed in order to receive brief summaries of updates published on the feed webpage.

**Aggregators** collect and interpret RSS feeds in one location.
